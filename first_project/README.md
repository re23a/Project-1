Hi everyone here is my first project at the Flutter bootcamp

A simple command-line project that provides multiple services ..

these services are :

    1: Display all books
    2: Search for books by title
    3: Add New Book
    4: Delete Book
    5: Purchase Book & invoice
    6: Edit book information
    Q: Quit

-first service is to Display all books:
